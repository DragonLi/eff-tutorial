\section{Further Reading}

\label{sect:further}

This tutorial has given an introduction to writing and reasoning about
side-effecting programs in \Idris{}, using the \effects{} library. More
details about the \emph{implementation} of the library, such as how
\texttt{run} works, how handlers are invoked, etc, are given in a
separate paper~\cite{brady-icfp2013}.

Some libraries and programs which use \effects{} can be found in the following
places:

\begin{itemize}
\item \url{http://github.com/edwinb/SDL-idris} --- some bindings for the SDL media
library, supporting graphics in particular.
\item \url{http://github.com/edwinb/idris-demos} --- various \Idris{} demonstration
programs, including several \effects{} examples from this tutorial, and
a ``Space Invaders'' game.
\item \url{https://github.com/SimonJF/IdrisNet2} --- networking and socket libraries.
\item \url{http://github.com/edwinb/Protocols} --- a high level communication
protocol description language.
\end{itemize}

The inspiration for the \effects{} library was Bauer and Pretnar's
Eff language~\cite{Bauer}, which describes a langauge based on algebraic
effects and handlers. Other recent languages and libraries have also been built
on this ideas, e.g.\cite{Lippmeier2009,handlers2013}. The theoretical
foundations are also
well-studied~\cite{Hyland2006,Levy2001,Plotkin2009,Pretnar2010}.
